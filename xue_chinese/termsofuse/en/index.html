  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>CONDITIONS OF USE</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Your Rights and Grant of Rights in the Content:</strong>&nbsp;Some content that you share or upload, such
    as&nbsp;comment, may be protected by intellectual property laws. You own the intellectual property rights (things
    like copyrights or trademarks) for any such content that you create and share on Xue Chinese . Nothing in these
    Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,
    wherever you want. However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a
    'license') to use this content. This is solely for the purpose of providing and improving our Products.
    Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in
    connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and
    worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create
    derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example,
    that if you share a&nbsp;comment&nbsp;on Xue Chinese , you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with
    others, (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Xue
    Chinese Products you use. This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems by either you or Xue
    Chinese . When content is deleted, it’s no longer visible to other users.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>User Conduct:</strong>&nbsp;You are solely responsible for all information, data, text, software, music,
    sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials (“Content”) that you upload, post, publish or
    display (hereinafter, “Post”) or email or otherwise transmit or use via the Service. The following are examples of

    users to any harm or liability of any type;

    materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Account verification:</strong>&nbsp;To make your experience as authentic as possible, and to ensure that all
    our users are interacting with real people, we may ask you to confirm your identity by verifying your email address
    or mobile phone number. We do not recommend opening multiple accounts, especially as it is not possible to merge or
    share data between two or more accounts when you sign in to our app. We also reserve the right to refuse any new
    account registrations if we find that you have previously registered for an account and your original or older
    account was permanently suspended for violating these terms of service.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Safety:</strong>&nbsp;In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove
    accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the security of other accounts and our
    services. We utilize a combination of manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to persistently or
    flagrantly abuse our community standards. We want to make sure that the content people are seeing on Xue Chinese is
    authentic. We believe that authenticity creates a better environment for sharing, and that having people on Xue
    Chinese who misrepresent themselves would harm the open environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    In certain cases, we will seek further information about an account before taking actions ranging from temporarily
    restricting accounts to permanently disabling them. We will evaluate accounts that misrepresent their identity by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      providing any false personal information or creating an account for anyone other than yourself without permission;
    </li>
    <li>
      using a name, user ID, nickname, or self-introduction that does not abide by our name policies;
    </li>
    <li>
      using a profile picture that does not abide by our picture policies, including, but not limited to, company logos,
      political figures, or other celebrities' photos;
    </li>
    <li>
      creating a single account that represents or is used by more than one person;
    </li>
    <li>
      maintaining multiple accounts as a single user;
    </li>
    <li>
      being compromised;
    </li>
    <li>
      being empty accounts with prolonged dormancy;
    </li>
    <li>
      using multiple Xue Chinese accounts;
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fees:</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that Xue Chinese reserves the right to charge for any portion of the
    Service and to change its fees (if any) from time to time in its discretion. You agree to pay all fees when due in
    accordance with the terms set forth on the Site.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Payment through the Service:</strong>&nbsp; Xue Chinese offers certain enhanced features of the Services
    which you can purchase in a variety of terms including, but not limited to, a three month, one year, monthly
    auto-recurring, yearly auto-recurring, and lifetime subscription (“Subscription”). A description of features
    associated with Subscriptions is available via the Services. The amounts due and payable by you for a Subscription
    that you purchase through the Services will be presented to you before you place your order.&nbsp;If you choose to
    purchase a Subscription via the Services, you agree (a) to pay the applicable fees and any taxes; (b) that Xue
    Chinese may charge your credit card for verification, pre-authorization and payment purposes if you purchase via the
    site, or if you purchase via the App, charge your account with the app store or distribution platform (like the
    Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is made available (each, an “App Provider”); and (c) to bear any
    additional charges that your App Provider, bank or other financial service provider may levy on you as well as any
    taxes or fees that may apply to your order.&nbsp; You’ll receive a confirmation email after we confirm the payment
    for your order. Your order is not binding on Xue Chinese until accepted and confirmed by Xue Chinese . All payments
    made are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3 style="color:#172B4D;font-size:16px;">
    Renewal and Cancellation of Subscriptions:&nbsp;All amounts are payable and charged: (i) for one-off purchase (i.e.
    lifetime Subscription), at the time you place your order; and (ii)&nbsp;For monthly, yearly, or other auto-recurring
    subscriptions, at the beginning of the subscription and, because each such subscription renews automatically for an
    additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term until you cancel it, at the time of each renewal
    until you cancel.&nbsp;You must cancel your monthly or yearly Subscription before it renews to avoid the billing of
    the fees for the next Subscription period. If you purchase your Subscription via the Site,&nbsp;you can cancel the
    renewal of your subscription at any time&nbsp;by contacting us by email at&nbsp;sjwu1234@gmail.com. If you purchase
    your Subscription via an App Provider,&nbsp;you can cancel the renewal of your subscription&nbsp;with the App
    Provider. You will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for your current subscription period and you
    will continue to receive the Services ordered until the end of your current Subscription period.
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first and you agree not to
    cancel or reject any credit card or App Provider charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the
    matter directly with Xue Chinese .
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Xue Chinese reserves the right to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances, for example, if your
    credit card is declined, if we suspect the request or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Xue Chinese
    deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Xue Chinese also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps
    to verify your identity in connection with your order. Xue Chinese will either not charge you or refund the charges
    for orders that we do not process or cancel.
